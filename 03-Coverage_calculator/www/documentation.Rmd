### Target Coverage

Targeted average coverage. Note that the standard deviation of the average coverage can be high.

### Estimated Reads on Target

For shotgun sequencing, this can usually be set to 100%. If you are interested in sequencing organellar genomes, the % of organellar DNA from the total DNA should be estimated. For plastid sequencing, this value is often at around 5%, but can vary with species or plant parts etc.


### Duplicates (%)

The number of duplicated sequences estimated for the process. This metric is strongly impacted by the number of PCR cycles applied during library preparation.
